Want to send me a care package?  Great!  Just please keep these considerations in mind:

* Contents must be **lightweight** or small portions.  As much as I want to carry that Costco sized bottle of Jack Daniel's with me, I will have to leave it behind :(
* Allow at least **7 days** for delivery.  I will not be able to go back for any package that arrives late.

## 1. Locate Post Office

Use [the map](/map) to find the next post office along my route.

## 2. Address the package as follows

Provide a return address off to the side, and add "Hold for A.T. hiker" and your expected arrival date. Writing legibly is important.

```
Your Name
Your Address

                            Business Name
                            123 ABC Street
                            City State, Zip Code

                            Hold for AT thru hiker: Daniel Dixon
                            eta 4/15
```

## 3. Notify me

Send me a [message](/message) to let me know to expect something.
