Want to send me a care package?  Great!  Just please keep these considerations in mind:

* Contents must be **lightweight** or small portions.  As much as I want to carry that Costco sized bottle of Jack Daniel's with me, I will have to leave it behind :( ...or chug it. 
* Allow several **7 days** for delivery.  If a package arrives too late, it may be difficult for me to retrieve it further down the trail.

## 1. Locate Post Office

Use [the map](/map) to find a [USPS post office](https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.action) or business along my route.  Post offices are preferred, however most businesses that cater to hikers (outfitters, outdoor stores, hotels, etc) will hold mail for a thru hiker.  It's best to call first!

[This site](http://www.soruck.net/at/) also seems to be a good resource.

You will not able to send **UPS or FedEx packages** to a USPS post office!  You will need to find a hiker friendly business to ship UPS or FedEx packages.

## 2. Address the package as follows

Provide a return address off to the side, and add "Please hold for AT thru hiker" and my expected arrival date. Writing legibly is important.
