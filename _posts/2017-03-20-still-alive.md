title: "Still Alive"

I'm still alive!  I have just had very poor cell reception so far.  But I'm in town (Hiwassee, GA) and decided it was time for an update!

The first two days on the trail, Tuesday and Wednesday were extremely cold!  The windchill Tuesday night was -5 degrees!!  It was actually quite dangerous to be out without being prepared, which many people weren't.  I stayed warm enough, but I was uncomfortable and got little sleep both nights.  Tossing and turning and not being able to get warm enough for 10+ hours is misery.

Luckily the weather has gotten significantly warmer, and the hiking (and sleeping) much better.  The last few days have been tough, going up and down mountains, but it is so rewarding when the weather is pleasent.  I've been getting into camp a little early most days and lounging in the hammock enjoying the warm sunny weather, which has been just been amazing.  I planned from the beginning to take it somewhat easy the first few weeks until my body is adjusted to the daily strain, so I haven't felt too tired yet.  The miles are increasing every day though, and each day is a new challenge.

The best part of the hike so far though has been all the people.  I'm convinced these are the nicest, most friendly group of people in the world.  Maybe it's the fresh air, maybe it's the shared struggle of going up and down mountains all day, but there is something out here that brings people together.  It doesn't matter how old you are, where you're from, or your political affiliation, on the AT you're part of a special community of hikers that are willing to share their food, water, and generosity so easily.  Without them it would just be a lonely, boring walk in the woods.

I will be posting a few pictures soon.  Next big update will probably be from Franklin, Tennessee!
