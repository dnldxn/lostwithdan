title: "Preparations"
---

I've been here in New York for the last few weeks having an amazing time exploring the city and watching a ton of Broadway shows.  Beth and I have seen a total of 8 shows so far, and every one has just been outstanding.  The four standouts, in no particular order, have to be:
* [Dear Evan Hansen](http://dearevanhansen.com/)
* [Hamilton](http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com/)
* [Come From Away](http://comefromaway.com/)
* [Natasa, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812](http://greatcometbroadway.com/)

I would highly recommend seeing any of these shows if you're ever in NYC!

As the start of the hike draws closer and closer, I don't feel as worried as I think I should feel.  I'm well beyond prepared, at least as far as the gear that I'm bringing.  Physically I feel good, and have been putting some miles on my feet just walking around NYC.  I feel confident that I've survived/enjoyed long hikes in the past.  Nothing could slow me down now... well except maybe rain.

I've been watching the weather forecast closely for the last couple of days.  I am hoping for a few days of no rain to start, so I can get adjusted to trail life, but the forecast keeps flipping back and forth between cloudy and rainy, so that sucks.  But hey, at least it will be relatively warm with high's in the 60's.  It could be much worse, knock on wood.

The next update will probably be a few days down the trail, so stay tuned for the inevitable "my whole body hurts" and "I have how many miles left??" posts!
